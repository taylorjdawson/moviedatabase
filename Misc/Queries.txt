PROOFREAD & TEST ALL QUERIES! Some of them might have long result times or flat out not work due to errors one person made that others might notice.
â€“Aaron

Queries that don't cause errors when run are marked with an X above the SQL. Queries that are confirmed to do what they're supposed to are marked with an O.

1) What movies (list title and year) have "george" (in any form) at the end of their titles. Order by the title.
O
select movies.title, movies.year 
from movies
where lower(right(title, 6)) = 'george'
order by title

2) Has any actor ever appeared in both a movie and an immediate remake of an immediate remake? If so, list the actor's stagename, the movie titles, the years, and the role. Order by stagename, year, and movie title.
X
select participant.name, movies.title, movies.year, acts_in.role
from movies, participant, acts_in, is_remake_of as r1, is_remake_of as r2
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and r1.remake_film_id = movies.film_id and r2.remake_film_id = movies.film_id and r1.remake_film_id = acts_in.film_id and r2.remake_film_id = acts_in.film_id and r1.remake_film_id = r2.original_film_id
order by participant.name, movies.year, movies.title

3) Which movie immediate remake is most similar to the original (i.e., has the highest percentage)? Show the title, year, director for the original movie and the remake along with the percentage of similarity between them; in the case of a tie, display them all.
select movies.title, movies.year, participant.name, max(is_remake_of.fraction) as most_similar
from movies, is_remake_of, participant, directs_movie
where movies.film_id = is_remake_of.original_film_id and directs_movie.film_id = movies.film_id and movies.film_id = directs_movie.film_id and directs_movie.participant_id = participant.participant_id and is_remake_of.fraction = most_similar

4) Which movie has been remade (directly or indirectly) the most times over all (i.e., is the ancestor of the most remakes)?
X
select movies.title
from movies, is_remake_of
where movies.film_id = is_remake_of.original_film_id
group by movies.title
order by count(movies.title)
LIMIT 1

5) Which movies are neither a remake nor have ever been remade? Order by title.
X
select movies.title
from movies, is_remake_of
where movies.film_id != is_remake_of.remake_film_id and movies.film_id != is_remake_of.original_film_id                
order by movies.title

6) List the stagename of actors that have won an Academy Award for their role in a movie; include their name and role, the name of the movie they won the award for, and the year they won; order the list by the year the movie was made.

order by movies.year

7) Which movies, by name, won Academy Awards in 1970?
X
select movies.title 
from movies, award, films_awarded
where award.award_id = films_awarded.award_id and award.award_name = 'Academy Award' and movies.year = '1970'
order by movies.title

This is what the query will look like when we execute it. Our current database doesn't have information on awards (hasn't been coded in yet) so for now this query can't be executed.

8) Has any original movie and an immediate remake both won an Academy Award? If so, list the name of the original and the remake along with the year for each ordered by name of the original and remake.
X
select movies.title, movies.year

order by movies.title

Like the above query, this query can't be executed yet since we don't have info on awards in our database yet.

order by movies.year

14) Is there an actor that has been a co-star with "Val Kilmer" and "Clint Eastwood" (not necessarily in the same movie)?!

                                             (select participant.name
                                             from participant, acts_in, movies
                                             where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and participant.name = 'Val Kilmer')
and exists (select participant.name
            from participant, acts_in, movies 
            where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and                                             participant.name = 'Clint Eastwood')

INCOMPLETE QUERY

16) List the names of all actors that have ever appeared in a movie directed by "Clint Eastwood" along with a count of how frequently they've appeared in his movies ordered by the count (descending) and their name (ascending).

order by movie_count
LIMIT 1

Like with the awards, we haven't added studios to the database yet, so we can't execute this query.
