Check to make sure the attributes used (i.e. ids, producers, directors, etc.) are all correct. Also, proofread queries, as some of them might have long result times due to errors one person made that others might notice.
Queries marked as incomplete are ones I couldn't figure out; if one of you guys wants to take a stab at them, go ahead.

order by participant.name, movies.year, movies.title

where movies.film_id = is_remake_of.original_film_id and directs_movie.film_id = movies.film_id and directs_movie.participant_id = participant.participant_id and is_remake_of.fraction = most_similar

4) Which movie has been remade (directly or indirectly) the most times over all (i.e., is the ancestor of the most remakes)?select movies.title

Like the above query, this query can't be executed yet since we don't have info on awards in our database yet.
