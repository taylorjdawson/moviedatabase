PROOFREAD & TEST ALL QUERIES! Some of them might have long result times or flat out not work due to errors one person made that others might notice.
â€“Aaron

Queries that don't cause errors when run are marked with an X above the SQL. Queries that are confirmed to do what they're supposed to are marked with an O.

1) What movies (list title and year) have "george" (in any form) at the end of their titles. Order by the title.
O
select movies.title, movies.year 
from movies
where lower(right(title, 6)) = 'george' or lower(right(title, 6)) = 'George' 
order by title

For this query, we simply checked whether the last 6 characters in the title were 'george' and then ordered those movies by their title.
Rows returned: 4

2) Has any actor ever appeared in both a movie and an immediate remake of an immediate remake? If so, list the actor's stagename, the movie titles, the years, and the role. Order by stagename, year, and movie title.
X
select participant.name, movies.title, movies.year, acts_in.role
from movies, participant, acts_in, is_remake_of as r1, is_remake_of as r2
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and r1.remake_film_id = movies.film_id and r2.remake_film_id = movies.film_id and r1.remake_film_id = acts_in.film_id and r2.remake_film_id = acts_in.film_id and r1.remake_film_id = r2.original_film_id
order by participant.name, movies.year, movies.title

3) Which movie immediate remake is most similar to the original (i.e., has the highest percentage)? Show the title, year, director for the original movie and the remake along with the percentage of similarity between them; in the case of a tie, display them all.
select movies.title, movies.year, participant.name, max(is_remake_of.fraction) as most_similar
from movies, is_remake_of, participant, directs_movie
where movies.film_id = is_remake_of.original_film_id and directs_movie.film_id = movies.film_id and movies.film_id = directs_movie.film_id and directs_movie.participant_id = participant.participant_id and is_remake_of.fraction = most_similar

4) Which movie has been remade (directly or indirectly) the most times over all (i.e., is the ancestor of the most remakes)?
X
select movies.title
from movies, is_remake_of
where movies.film_id = is_remake_of.original_film_id
group by movies.title
order by count(movies.title)
LIMIT 1

5) Which movies are neither a remake nor have ever been remade? Order by title.
X
select movies.title
from movies, is_remake_of
where movies.film_id != is_remake_of.remake_film_id or movies.film_id != is_remake_of.original_film_id                
order by movies.title

6) List the stagename of actors that have won an Academy Award for their role in a movie; include their name and role, the name of the movie they won the award for, and the year they won; order the list by the year the movie was made.
X
select participant.name, acts_in.role, movies.title, movies.year 
from participant, movies, acts_in, awards, participant_is_awarded
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and participant.participant_id = acts_in.participant_id and participant.participant_id = participant_is_awarded.participant_id and awards.award_id = participant_is_awarded.award_id and awards.award_id = 0
order by movies.year

This query cannot be completed because our database doesn't connect roles to awards. Because of this, the query in our database gets actors that have won an award, but returns every role those actors have ever done rather than just the ones they did for the award. 

7) Which movies, by name, won Academy Awards in 1970?
X
select movies.title 
from movies, awards, movie_is_awarded
where movies.film_id = movie_is_awarded.film_id and awards.award_id = movie_is_awarded.award_id and awards.award_id = 0 and movies.year = '1969'
order by movies.title

Academy Awards are typically awarded for movies made the year before, so we checked movies made in 1969.

8) Has any original movie and an immediate remake both won an Academy Award? If so, list the name of the original and the remake along with the year for each ordered by name of the original and remake.
X
select m1.title, m1.year, m2.title, m2.year
from movies as m1, movies as m2, is_remake_of as r, awards, movie_is_awarded
where m1.film_id = r.original_film_id and m1.film_id = movie_is_awarded.film_id and m2.film_id = r.remake_film_id and m2.film_id = movie_is_awarded.film_id and awards.award_id = 0
order by m1.title, m2.title

Like the above query, this query can't be executed yet since we don't have info on awards in our database yet.

9) Find the name and year of the movie that has the shortest title.
O
select movies.title, movies.year
from movies
order by length(movies.title) ASC
LIMIT 1

FOr this query, we got the title and year of every movie and ordered them by the length of their titles in ascending order, which meant the shortest title was the first row returned. Then, we limited the results to 1 entry so only that first row was shown.
Rows returned: 1

10) What movies did "George Fox" write?
X
select movies.title 
from movies, writes_movie
where movies.film_id = writes_movie.film_id and writes_movie.writer_name = 'George Fox'

Our database has writers by their name and film, so the query is simply getting the id's of the movies in the writes_movie table and then getting the name of the writer associated with those ids.
Rows returned: 0

11) Are there any actors that have played more than one role in the same movie? If so, list the movie title, the actor's name and the roles they played. Order by movie title, actor's name, and role.
select movies.title, participant.name, acts_in.role
from movies, participant, acts_in
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id
order by movies.title, participant.name, acts_in.role
INCOMPLETE QUERY

12) Are there any pairs of actors that appeared together in two different movies released in the same year? If so, list the movie titles, the years, the actor's names and the roles they played. Order by movie title, year, actor's names, and roles.
select movies.title, movies.year, actors.stage_name, actors.role
from  movies, acts_in, participant
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and participant.participant_id = acts_in.participant_id
order by movies.title, movies.year, stage_name, acts_in.role
INCOMPLETE QUERY

13) List the title, year, and role of movies that "Tom Cruise" appeared in ordered by the year.
O
select DISTINCT movies.title, movies.year, acts_in.role 
from movies, acts_in, participant
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and participant.name = 'Tom Cruise'
order by movies.year

14) Is there an actor that has been a co-star with "Val Kilmer" and "Clint Eastwood" (not necessarily in the same movie)?!
X
select participant.name
from participant, acts_in, movies
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and exists 
                                             (select participant.name
                                             from participant, acts_in, movies
                                             where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and participant.name = 'Val Kilmer')
and exists (select participant.name
            from participant, acts_in, movies 
            where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and                                             participant.name = 'Clint Eastwood') 
            and participant.name != 'Val Kilmer' and participant.name != 'Clint Eastwood'

15) Give me the names of all actors within "six degrees" of "Kevin Bacon". Specifically, Bacon's co-stars (1st degree), the co-star's co-stars (2nd degree), etc. out to "six degrees". List the actors ordered by stagename.
select actors.stage_name
from actors, acts_in, movies
where movie_id = acts_in.film_id and stage_name != 'Kevin Bacon' and (six degrees here)
order by stage_name
INCOMPLETE QUERY

16) List the names of all actors that have ever appeared in a movie directed by "Clint Eastwood" along with a count of how frequently they've appeared in his movies ordered by the count (descending) and their name (ascending).
X
select participant.name, count(movies) as movie_count
from participant, acts_in, movies, directs_movie
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and participant.participant_id = acts_in.participant_id and movies.film_id = directs_movie.film_id and participant.participant_id = directs_movie.film_id and participant.name = 'Clint Eastwood'
group by participant.name
order by movie_count DESC, participant.name ASC

17) What are the categories (i.e., genre) of movies that "Ronald Reagan" has appeared in as an actor? 
O
select DISTINCT movies.genre 
from movies, acts_in, participant
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and participant.name = 'Ronald Reagan' 

18) Which studio has made the most movies and how many have they made?
O
select studios.studio_name, count(movies) as movie_count
from movies, studios, has_studio
where movies.film_id = has_studio.film_id and studios.studio_id = has_studio.studio_id
group by studios.studio_name
order by movie_count DESC
LIMIT 1

This query selects movies that have studios and then groups them by their studio. The movies are then counted for each studio and ordered by their counts in descending order so the studio with the most movies is at the top, and then the query is limited to 1 result so only that studio is returned.
Rows returned: 1 (mgm, 491 movies)

Like with the awards, we haven't added studios to the database yet, so we can't execute this query.

19) "Paramount" is a famous studio. What category (i.e., genre) of movie was most commonly made by "Paramount"?
O
select movies.genre
from movies, studios, has_studio
where studios.studio_id = has_studio.studio_id and movies.film_id = has_studio.film_id and studios.studio_name = 'paramount'
group by movies.genre
order by count(genre) DESC
LIMIT 1

This query is like the above query, only the movies are grouped by genres instead of studios, and the only studio we're looking for is Paramount. (lowercase in our database)
Rows returned: 1 (comedy, 97 times)

Once again, no studio info yet, so we can't do this query.

20) Has any person directed and produced a movie they've also acted in? If so, give their stagename, the title of the movie they directed and produced, and the role they played.
X
select participant.name, movies.title, acts_in.role
from movies, participant, directs_movie, acts_in 
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and directs_movie.film_id = movies.film_id and directs_movie.film_id = acts_in.film_id and directs_movie.participant_id = participant.participant_id

21) For all of the generic roletypes for actors, list the name of the roletype and a count of how many actors are classified by that type in descending order of the counts.
O
select acts_in.role_type, count(acts_in.participant_id) as role_type_count
from acts_in
where acts_in.role_type != ''
group by acts_in.role_type 
order by role_type_count DESC

This query selects all the role types present in the acts_in table and counts how many times each role type shows up. (we excluded blank entries for role types) The role types and their counts are then grouped together and ordered in descending order.
Rows returned: 11490

22) For all of the generic categories for movies (e.g., "drama", "mystery"), list the name of the category (long form, if possible) and a count of how many movies are in that category in descending order of the counts.
O
select movies.genre, count(movies) as movie_count
from movies
where movies.genre != 'Null'
group by movies.genre
order by movie_count DESC

This query is just like the above query, only we selected genres instead of role types (so we used the movies table instead of the acts_in table) and excluded null values instead of blank values.
Rows returned: 101

23) Who was the oldest actor to appear in a movie? I.e., has the largest difference between their date of birth and the release of a movie they appeared in. Give their name, rough age at the time, title of the movie, and the role they played; in the case of a tie, display them all.
select participant.name, max(participant.date_of_death - participant.date_of_birth) as age, movies.title, acts_in.role
from participant, acts_in, movies
where movies.film_id = acts_in.film_id and acts_in.participant_id = participant.participant_id and participant.date_of_birth != NULL and participant.date_of_death != NULL and participant.date_of_death - participant.date_of_birth = age 
group by participant.name, movies.title, acts_in.role
